'''# Comments aare green and used to explain codes, they start with #
#Python has no command for declaring variables, a variable is created the moment you 1st assigne a value to it
x = 5

print (x)

#Variables have types
x = 4 # x is of type int
x = "Sally" # x is now of type str

#Casting
#Casting is to specify the data type of a variable 
x = str (3) # x will be string or word '3'
y = int (3) # y will be number 3
z = float (3) # z will be 3.0

#How to print the type 
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print (type(y))
# Note: "" is same as '' so "x" is same as 'x'
#Case Sensitivity
a = 4
A = "Sally"
#A will NOT overwrite a

#NAMING VARIABLES:
#1 A variable name must start with a letter or underscore 
#2 Avaiable name cannot start with a number
#3 A variable name are case sensitive
